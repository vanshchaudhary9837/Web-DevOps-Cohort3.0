The fs module in Node.js, short for File System, is a core module that provides an API for interacting with the file system of the operating system. It allows you to perform various file and directory operations, such as reading from and writing to files, creating and deleting directories, and managing file permissions.
Key features of the fs module:

1.Built-in:

    The fs module is a core Node.js module, meaning it is available by default and does not require any additional installation.

2.Synchronous and Asynchronous Methods:

    It offers both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) methods for most operations. Asynchronous methods are generally preferred in production applications to maintain responsiveness and prevent blocking the event loop.

3.Common Operations:

    The fs module provides functions for a wide range of file system tasks, including:

    - Reading files: fs.readFile() (asynchronous), fs.readFileSync() (synchronous)

    - Writing to files: fs.writeFile() (asynchronous), fs.writeFileSync() (synchronous)

    - Appending to files: fs.appendFile() (asynchronous), fs.appendFileSync() (synchronous)

    - Renaming files: fs.rename() (asynchronous), fs.renameSync() (synchronous)

    - Deleting files: fs.unlink() (asynchronous), fs.unlinkSync() (synchronous)

    - Creating directories: fs.mkdir() (asynchronous), fs.mkdirSync() (synchronous)

    -Reading directory contents: fs.readdir() (asynchronous), fs.readdirSync() (synchronous)

    - Getting file information: fs.stat() (asynchronous), fs.statSync() (synchronous)
